# How to Harden Ubuntu Server

{% hint style="success" %}
Thank you for your support and kind messages! It really energizes us to keep creating the best crypto guides. Use [cointr.ee to find our donation ](https://cointr.ee/coincashew)addresses and share your message. üôè 
{% endhint %}

## üßô‚ôÇ Create a non-root user with sudo privileges

{% hint style="info" %}
Make a habit of logging to your server using a non-root account. This will prevent the accidental deletion of files if you make a mistake. For instance, the command rm can wipe your entire server if run incorrectly using by a root user.
{% endhint %}

SSH to your server

```text
ssh username@server.ip.address
```

Create a new user called cardano

```text
useradd -m -s /bin/bash cardano
```

Set the password for cardano user

```text
passwd cardano
```

Add cardano to the sudo group

```text
usermod -aG sudo cardano
```

## \*\*\*\*üîè **Disable SSH password Authentication and Use SSH Keys only**

{% hint style="info" %}
The basic rules of hardening SSH are:

* No password for SSH access \(use private key\)
* Don't allow root to SSH \(the appropriate users should SSH in, then `su` or `sudo`\)
* Use `sudo` for users so commands are logged
* Log unauthorized login attempts \(and consider software to block/ban users who try to access your server too many times, like fail2ban\)
* Lock down SSH to only the ip range your require \(if you feel like it\)
{% endhint %}

Create a new SSH key pair on your local machine. Run this on your local machine.

```text
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

Transfer the public key to your remote node. Update the **keyname**.

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i $HOME/.ssh/<keyname>.pub cardano@server.ip.address
```

Login with your new cardano user

```text
ssh cardano@server.ip.address
```

Disable root login and password based login. Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config file`

```text
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Locate **ChallengeResponseAuthentication** and update to no

```text
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
```

Locate **PasswordAuthentication** update to no

```text
PasswordAuthentication no 
```

Locate **PermitRootLogin** and update to no

```text
PermitRootLogin no
```

Locate **PermitEmptyPasswords** and update to no

```text
PermitEmptyPasswords no
```

**Optional**: Locate **Port** and customize it your **random** port.

```bash
Port <port number>
```

Validate the syntax of your new SSH configuration.

```text
sudo sshd -t
```

If no errors with the syntax validation, reload the SSH process

```text
sudo service sshd reload
```

Verify the login still works

```text
ssh cardano@server.ip.address
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Alternatively, you might need to use 

```bash
ssh -i <path to your SHH_key_name.pub> cardano@server.ip.address
```
{% endhint %}

## \*\*\*\*ü§ñ **Update your system**

{% hint style="warning" %}
It's critically important to keep your system up-to-date with the latest patches to prevent intruders from accessing your system.
{% endhint %}

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get autoclean
```

Enable automatic updates so you don't have to manually install them.

```text
sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades
```

## üß∏ Disable root account

System admins should not frequently log in as root in order to maintain server security. Instead, you can use sudo execute that require low-level privileges.

```bash
# To disable the root account, simply use the -l option.
sudo passwd -l root
```

```bash
# If for some valid reason you need to re-enable the account, simply use the -u option.
sudo passwd -u root
```

## üõ† Setup Two Factor Authentication for SSH

{% hint style="info" %}
SSH, the secure shell, is often used to access remote Linux systems. Because we often use it to connect with computers containing important data, it‚Äôs recommended to add another security layer. Here comes the two factor authentication \(_2FA_\).
{% endhint %}

```text
sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator -y
```

To make SSH use the Google Authenticator PAM module, edit the `/etc/pam.d/sshd` file:

```text
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sshd 
```

Add the follow line:

```text
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
```

Now you need to restart the `sshd` daemon using:

```text
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
```

Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` 

```text
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Locate **ChallengeResponseAuthentication** and update to yes

```text
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
```

Locate **UsePAM** and update to yes

```text
UsePAM yes
```

Save the file and exit.

Run the **google-authenticator** command.

```text
google-authenticator
```

It will ask you a series of questions, here is a recommended configuration:

* Make tokens ‚Äútime-base‚Äù": yes
* Update the `.google_authenticator` file: yes
* Disallow multiple uses: yes
* Increase the original generation time limit: no
* Enable rate-limiting: yes

You may have noticed the giant QR code that appeared during the process, underneath are your emergency scratch codes to be used if you don‚Äôt have access to your phone: write them down on paper and keep them in a safe place.

Now, open Google Authenticator on your phone and add your secret key to make two factor authentication work.

## üß© Secure Shared Memory

{% hint style="info" %}
One of the first things you should do is secure the shared [memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) used on the system. If you're unaware, shared memory can be used in an attack against a running service. Because of this, secure that portion of system memory.
{% endhint %}

Edit `/etc/fstab`

```text
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Insert the following line to the bottom of the file and save/close.

```text
tmpfs	/run/shm	tmpfs	ro,noexec,nosuid	0 0
```

Reboot the node in order for changes to take effect.

```text
sudo reboot
```

## \*\*\*\*‚õì **Install Fail2ban**

{% hint style="info" %}
Fail2ban is an intrusion-prevention system that monitors log files and searches for particular patterns that correspond to a failed login attempt. If a certain number of failed logins are detected from a specific IP address \(within a specified amount of time\), fail2ban blocks access from that IP address.
{% endhint %}

```text
sudo apt-get install fail2ban -y
```

Edit a config file that monitors SSH logins.

```text
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Add the following lines to the bottom of the file.

```bash
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = <22 or your random port number>
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3
```

Save/close file. 

Restart fail2ban for settings to take effect.

```text
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

## \*\*\*\*üß± **Configure your Firewall**

The standard UFW firewall can be used to control network access to your node.

With any new installation, ufw is disabled by default. Enable it with the following settings.

* Port 22 \(or your random port \#\) TCP for SSH connection
* Port 6000 TCP for p2p traffic
* Port 3000 TCP for Grafana web server \(if hosted on this node\)

```bash
ufw allow <22 or your random port number>/tcp
ufw allow 6000/tcp
ufw allow 3000/tcp
ufw enable
ufw status numbered
```

Confirm the settings are in effect.

>      To                         Action      From
>      --                         ------      ----
> [ 1] 22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
> [ 2] 3000/tcp                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere
> [ 3] 6000/tcp                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere
> [ 4] 22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
> [ 5] 3000/tcp (v6)              ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
> [ 6] 6000/tcp (v6)              ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
> ```

## üî≠ Verify Listening Ports

If you want to maintain a secure server, you should validate the listening network ports every once in a while. This will provide you essential information about your network.

```text
netstat -tulpn
ss -tulpn
```
